<br />Archaeopteryx: A Ruby <span class="caps">MIDI</span> Generator</p>


<div style="float:left; padding-right: 10px">
<img src="/images/giles_bowkett.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

	<p>Archaeopteryx generates <span class="caps">MIDI</span> bytecodes which produce music via
prosumer applications such as Propellerhead Reason. If you&#8217;ve ever
wondered whether or not use cases really exist for Ruby features like
lambda, eval, continuations, and higher-order functions, Archaeopteryx
demonstrates not just the usefulness but the power and flexibility of
these techniques. Archaeopteryx also uses statistical AI methods -
specifically, probability matrices, similar to those used in naive
Bayesian classifiers &#8211; to define templates for possible grooves.</p>


	<p>An experiment in progress, Archaeopteryx currently generates techno
drum rhythms and New-Agey ambient soundscapes with ease. Developing
additional features by the time of GoRuCo is very, very likely.
Following the pattern of all successful technology projects,
Archaeopteryx targets low-hanging fruit with superior technology, and
scales up from there. This presentation will feature no slides at all,
and focus instead on demonstrations, explaining existing code, and
writing new code live.</p>


	<p>Giles Bowkett&#8217;s programming blog is well-read in the Ruby community
and occasionally gets 10,000-visit days. He has worked with Perl, <span class="caps">PHP</span>,
Python, Java, JavaScript, ActionScript &#8211; all the usual suspects &#8211; and
now spends nearly all his time coding Ruby. He&#8217;s worked on the
streaming video site Hulu and contributed a patch to Rubinius, he has
a recipe in the upcoming &#8220;Advanced Rails Recipes&#8221; book, he&#8217;s speaking
at five conferences in three countries in 2008, he regularly checks in
code before 8am on Saturdays, he kind of needs to get a life, and
between December and February 2007-2008 he released 9 open source
projects (with more coming). Giles studies acting with the same
feverish intensity he applies to programming. He also practices
meditation, which, when you consider everything else, is probably a
good idea.</p>

<br />Hurting Code for Fun and Profit</p>


<div style="float:left; padding-right: 10px">
<img src="/images/ryan_davis.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

	<p>The combination of living ascetic coding style and using tools to help enforce an ascetic style greatly helps code thrive in its purest form. Hurting code by eschewing complexity and enforcing a good testing style can be both fun and profitable if you look at it the right way. &#8220;Hurting Code for Fun and Profit&#8221; will introduce both the philosophy and tools used to enhance an ascetic coding style.</p>


	<p>Ryan Davis has been using Ruby since 2000 and is a founding member of the Seattle Ruby Brigade, the ass-kickingest ruby brigade (per-capita). His background includes QA, automation and tool development, object databases, and smalltalk. In ruby/rails, he has worked on developer productivity and test automation tools such as flog, heckle, hoe, ParseTree, ruby2c, ruby2ruby, RubyInline, ZenTest, and more.</p>

<br />Collective Intelligence: Leveraging User Data to Create Intelligent
Rails Applications</p>


<div style="float:left; padding-right: 10px">
<img src="/images/paul_dix.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

	<p>Take advantage of user data to create intelligent applications. This
talk will focus on data mining to create complex application behavior
and gain insight into the patterns and habits of your users. Examples
of these techniques can be seen with recommendation systems like those
created by Amazon, Netflix, last.fm, and others. Additional examples
include spam filtering systems for email or comment filtering provided
by Akismet.</p>


	<p>We will focus on techniques for gathering data, specific gems and
plugins for performing various data mining and machine learning tasks,
and performance issues like how to distribute the work to separate
servers. Theory in this talk will be light and the specific algorithms
will only get a mention by name. We&#8217;ll be looking at real world Ruby
and Rails code examples for building recommendation, ranking, and
classification systems.</p>


	<p>Paul Dix has been working with Ruby and Rails since 2005 when he first
started attending meetings at <span class="caps">NYC</span>.rb. Paul was a speaker at GoRuCo
2007 where he presented on the topic of document classification. He is
also the author of the Basset Ruby Gem, which provides an <span class="caps">API</span> for
various machine learning tasks. Paul has worked in companies large and
small as a consultant, developer, network engineer, and software
tester. The big names include Google, Microsoft, McAfee, and Air Force
Space Command. He currently works for Mint Digital where he
contributes to various Rails applications for clients and Mint&#8217;s Rails
application platform. In addition to his consulting, Paul is working
on a new startup that makes use of collective intelligence techniques.
He is also currently a student at Columbia University where he studies
topics in machine learning, natural language processing, information
retrieval, and search.</p>

<br />Story Driven Development: The Next Generation of Rails Functional Testing</p>


<div style="float:left; padding-right: 10px">
<img src="/images/bryan_helmkamp.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

	<p>Story Driven Development (SDD) helps close the gap between the
language of developers and product owners so they can clearly define
when software is &#8220;done&#8221;. Readable and executable product requirements
are now possible. We&#8217;ll explore tips for integrating <span class="caps">SDD</span> into your
existing workflow and cover technical details for implementing and
maintaining stories using cutting-edge tools and libraries.</p>


	<p>Bryan Helmkamp is a senior Rails software engineer at weplay in New
York.  He is a strong advocate for Behavior Driven Development and an
active participant in the RSpec community. Recently, he released the
Webrat (Ruby Acceptance Testing for Web applications) plugin, which
many developers are using to drive their customer-facing acceptance
tests in a more expressive way. During his three years of professional
Ruby/Rails programming he has been continually active in the community
by organizing events like Rails Day 2007 and co-organizing the first
(and the upcoming second) annual Gotham Ruby Conference (GoRuCo).

<br />Forbidden Fruit: A Taste of Ruby&#8217;s Parse Tree</p>


<div style="float:left; padding-right: 10px">
<img src="/images/chris_wanstrath.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

	<p>Metaprogramming is not that big of a deal.  Yeah, we were super
pumped
about it at first.  We tried to stay sane while reading _why&#8217;s book.
We had our minds blown by Bill Katz at RailsConf 2006.  We were up
way
past our bedtime twisting define_method.  But now things are
different.  Today we constantly (class &lt;&lt; self; self end) and
send(method).  It&#8217;s just a part of life, y&#8217;know?</p>


	<p>This talk is about Ruby&#8217;s parse tree.  I&#8217;ll introduce it and explain
what it is, especially its relation to other languages (since most
everyone has one), then dive into the nitty gritty: how you get to it
in Ruby, what it looks like, and what you can do with it.  The doing
being the big part.</p>


	<p>Chris Wanstrath lives in San Francisco and freaking loves Ruby.  He
writes for Err the Blog, works at Err Free, keeps in touch using
FamSpam, and uses GitHub for everything else.</p>

<br /> Merb, All you need, None you don&#8217;t</p>


<div style="float:left; padding-right: 10px">
<img src="/images/ezra_zygmuntowicz.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

	<p>Merb is a ruby web framework with a focus on performance, modularity and simple non magical code. In this talk we will explore some of the more advanced concepts of the framework and how it was put together. One of the guiding philosophies of merb is to be transparent and hackable. No black boxes or sausage here, we like to encourage merb users to open up the framework to explore and bend it to their will.</p>


	<p>Ezra Zygmuntowicz has been a member of the ruby community for almost 5 years now. He has written &#8220;Deploying Rails Applications&#8221; for the pragmatic programmers as well as speaking at many ruby related conferences. Ezra is a cofounder and lead Software Developer at EngineYard.com.</p>
