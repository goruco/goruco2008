	<p>Pace Plaza is on Spruce Street between William and Gold Streets. The 4, 5, 6 City Hall subway stop provides the shortest, easiest walk to it. GoRuCo organizers and Pace students will be just inside the main doors to help register attendees.</p>

  <h3><a href="/articles/2008/04/27/goruco-2008-is-over/">GoRuCo 2008 is over</a></h3>
  <p>The streamers have all been pulled down, and the bar&#8217;s all out of banana daiquiris&#8212;which must mean that GoRuCo 2008 is officially over. We organizers had a ton of fun, and we hope you all did too: listening to Giles rant about &#8220;Muppet Fuckers&#8221;, getting down with the deep math-fu of Paul&#8217;s talk, marveling over the access point, swanking it up at the Tribeca Grand, and for some of us, finally, finally, singing some goddamned karaoke. Ah, karaoke. At the end of that long day and night it was like an oasis in the desert&#8212;if that oasis were full of people screaming Bon Jovi at the top of their lungs. And if instead of water, you had beer.</p>


	<p>We are recommending those of you who are blogging, posting photos, etc., to use the tag &#8220;goruco2008&#8221;. You can already see a lot of photos on <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/goruco2008/">Flickr</a>, and see a handful of <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/goruco2008">del.icio.us links</a> too.</p>


	<p>And Confreaks will be posting videos of every single talk online, for free, in the near future. Watch this space for that announcement.</p>


	<p>Thanks to everyone who came, and we hope to see you next year!</p>

  <h3><a href="/articles/2008/04/23/dont-forget-about-rejectconf/">Don't forget about RejectConf</a></h3>
  RejectConf! All the cool kids are doing it. If you have something quick to say, don't forget that we've got an hour set aside at the end of the day for people to get up and talk about random stuff. And our RejectConf master of ceremonies will be none other than Mister RejectConf himself, Ryan Davis. So, if your talk was actually rejected, or you just created the coolest Ruby thing ever in the last week, keep in mind that you'll have a chance to tell everyone about it at the end of the day.

  <h3><a href="/articles/2008/04/21/agenda-up/">Agenda up</a></h3>
  <p>We&#8217;ve posted the new, final <a href="http://2008.goruco.com/agenda/">agenda</a>, which accounts for our last-minute speaker switch. But the general outline of the day is still the same: Registration at 9 a.m., opening remarks at 9:45 a.m., first talk at 10 a.m.</p>

  <h3><a href="/articles/2008/04/18/last-minute-speaker-change/">Last-minute speaker change</a></h3>
  <p>We have a last-minute program change to announce: Alex Payne isn&#8217;t going to be able to come to GoRuCo next Saturday and give his talk. In Alex&#8217;s place, we have arranged for Ryan Davis to give his talk &#8220;Hurting Code for Fun and Profit&#8221;.</p>


	<p>It&#8217;s certainly not ideal to have to change the program at such a late date, and Alex&#8217;s talk will be greatly missed. That being said, we&#8217;re excited to be able to include Ryan&#8217;s talk in the program, and we&#8217;re still looking forward to a great Ruby-filled day for all our attendees.</p>


	<p>If you&#8217;re interested in who&#8217;s going to be speaking at what time, you should know that we will be re-arranging the schedule to accommodate this change in the program. Hopefully we can get something decided and posted within the next day or so.</p>


	<p>See you all in nine days!</p>
